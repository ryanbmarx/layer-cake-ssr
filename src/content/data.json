Guidelines were released by the state's department of education to start reopening schools in the fall. Gov. Brian Kemp on May 12 announced plans to relax some restaurant restrictions and allow some summer camps to open but extend bar and nightclub closures through May. Kemp allowed businesses such as tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and hair and nail salons to reopen with restrictions in late April, a sweeping move that prompted national criticism. Restaurants and movie theaters have since been able to welcome customers back in on a limited basis, and a statewide shelter-at-home order has expired. Some malls reopened May 4, though things were far from normal with many businesses inside still shuttered and parking lots sparsely filled.",
